This repository contains an Excel-based simulation for distributing employee bonuses based on various input criteria and scenarios. Designed as part of an academic project, it models how structured spreadsheets and logic formulas can support incentive planning and transparent reward allocation.

## 📁 Files Included

- `ergasia_4.doc.xlsx`: Main worksheet with structured bonus distribution logic, formulas, and test data.
- `prototype.xlsx`: Early design or simplified mockup of the incentive model.
- `file.xlsx`: Supplemental or raw input data used in calculations or test cases.

## 🧠 Key Features

- Calculates employee bonuses based on performance, role, or target-based rules
- Utilizes functions like `IF`, `VLOOKUP`, `SUMIF`, and conditional formatting
- Structured for ease of data entry and result interpretation
- Adaptable for small teams or organization-wide incentive plans

## 🔍 Use Case

This simulation helps demonstrate:
- Bonus allocation fairness
- What-if analysis for changing thresholds or bonus pools
- How Excel can model HR/payroll logic with no coding required

## 🇬🇷 Greek Context

Formulas, data formats, and structure follow Greek conventions and academic project guidelines.

## ✅ How to Use

1. Open `ergasia_4.doc.xlsx`
2. Enter or adjust employee data and bonus criteria
3. Review automatic calculations and adjust as needed
4. Use `prototype.xlsx` or `file.xlsx` for testing and development purposes
